# A dumb C library I made
My own C library to implement data structures and algorithms 

---

For code style, Chaotic Good naming convension is used.
* `snake_case` for variables
* `camelCase` for functions
* `PascalCase` for struct/class/types

No complex build system is used. All the libraries are modular.

### Implemented Data Structures:
1. Rust inspired String type
2. Vector arrays
