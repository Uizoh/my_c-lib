# A dumb C library I made
My own C library(I don't know if I can call it a library) to implement data structures and algorithms. 

**NOTE: Not meant for real life usage!** 

---

For code style, ***Chaotic Good*** naming convention is used.
* `snake_case` for variables
* `camelCase` for functions
* `PascalCase` for struct/class/types

No complex build system is used. All the libraries are modular.

## Implemented Data Structures:
1. String type(Rust inspired)
2. Vector array
